A Windows program to inject *.DLL files
# Usage
1: Download the program from the releases section, or build it yourself if you have visual studio c++

# Backstory
The story behind me creating this program was me wanting to learn low level things like memory manipulation and also to become better at c++. I still like java better for now tho :/
