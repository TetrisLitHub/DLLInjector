# DLLInjector
A Windows program to inject *.DLL files
# Usage
1: Download the program from the releases section, or build it yourself if you have visual studio c++

2: Run the executable 

(notice: this uses windows library so it probably won't work on MacOS or Linux distros)

(also you may need to run as administrator)

(ALERT/UPDATE: Your antivirus may detect this as a trojan, in which case you'll have to create an exception for this program or disable your AV temporarily. Before the program runs you might also get a screen saying that windows prevented an unrecognized app from running. To get past this screen, click More Info, then click Run Anyways.


3: Input your target window and path of the DLL when it says to

4: profit
# Backstory
The story behind me creating this program was me wanting to learn low level things like memory manipulation and also to become better at c++. I still like java better for now tho :/
